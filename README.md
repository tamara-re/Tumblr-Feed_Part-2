# Project 6 - *Tumblr Blog*

Submitted by: **Tamara Regalado Quiroz**

**Tumblr Blog** is an app that is an app that displays tumblr blogs at the palm of your hands

Time spent: 14 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Setup navigation to the Detail Screen
- [x] Created the Detail View UI
- [x] Add the ability to pass data to the Detail View Controller
- [x] Made personal finishing touches to the UI


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    I think I can try and add more personalizations and decorations to the detail view, however it would take much longer

## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.
